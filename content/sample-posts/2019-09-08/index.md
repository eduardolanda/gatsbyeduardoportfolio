Live project at [LIVE PROJECT LINK](http://foodmenureact.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com) by [@eduardolanda](https://github.com/eduardolanda).

I created this project using only React.Js and some Material-UI components and Axios. This web app allows you to retrieve some recipes from a public API with all the ingrediens you would need.

Why did I create this project?

- A food menu with React? Do you neee more reasons?
- Next, I like to practice using frameworks, sucha as ReactJs.
- Just for fun.

If you **want to add more options**, let me know and we may work together to make it happen.

Here's an image of Food Menu in action:
