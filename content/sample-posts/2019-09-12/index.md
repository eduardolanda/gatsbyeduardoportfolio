I created this project called Geo Dairy to register events from your day and ping a location and show it on the map.

Why did I create this project?

- First, I wanted to use Map-Box with ReactJs.
- Next, I wanted to see how my idea would look like in an web app.
- Just for fun.

If you **want to integrate GraphQL**, let me know and we may work together to make it happen.

All the data has been stored locally and the idea is to create an MVP to present my idea using this web app.

Here's an image of a Geo Diary in action:

Let's make ideas real.
