Live project at [LIVE PROJECT LINK](http://beermenureact.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com) by [@eduardolanda](https://github.com/eduardolanda).

This project was created using the Beer API, I used React.Js, Material-UI and Axios to retrieve the information.

Why did I create this project?

- I wanted to practice using AXIOS and also, I wanted to show the speed and advantages of using React.JS
- Next, I like beers and I learnt about some beer locations on USA.
- Just for fun.

If you **want to change the design**, let me know and we may work together to make it happen.

Here's an image of Beer Menu in action:
