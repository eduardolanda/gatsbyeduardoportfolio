Live project at [LIVE PROJECT LINK](http://pokedexeduardo.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.comnaws.com) by [@eduardolanda](https://github.com/eduardolanda).

I created this project using only React.Js and some Material-UI components, It's a simple web app that represents a Pokedex, the famoust gadget to get stats from different pokemons.

Why did I create this project?

- I like Pokemon? Any other reason?
- Next, I like to practice using frameworks, sucha as ReactJs.
- Just for fun.

If you **want to add more options**, let me know and we may work together to make it happen.
