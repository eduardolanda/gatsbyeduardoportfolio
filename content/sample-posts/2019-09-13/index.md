Live project at [LIVE PROJECT LINK](http://reactandmorty.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com) by [@eduardolanda](https://github.com/eduardolanda).

This project was created using the Rick And Morty API, I used React.Js, Material-UI and Axios to retrieve the information.

Why did I create this project?

- I really like this TV show and wanted to created something with it.
- Next, I wanted to practice using Axios to get information from an API.
- Just for fun.

If you **want to change the design**, let me know and we may work together to make it happen.

I added pagination and some animation using React-Reveal

Here's an image of React and Morty in action:

Let's make ideas real.
