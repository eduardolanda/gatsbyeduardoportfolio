Live project at [LIVE PROJECT LINK](http://truthordaregame.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com) by [@eduardolanda](https://github.com/eduardolanda).

I created this project using only React.Js and some Material-UI components, It's a simple web app that represents the game Truth Or Dare and It helps to identify how React Works, not reloading.

Why did I create this project?

- If I wanted to hang out with my friend,I would like to play a game I created.
- Next, I think it would look nice.
- Just for fun.

If you **want to add more options**, let me know and we may work together to make it happen.

Here's an image of Truth Or Dare in action:
